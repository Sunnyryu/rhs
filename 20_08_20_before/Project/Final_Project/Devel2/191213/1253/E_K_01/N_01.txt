• What we’re reading

Back to logistics. As long as people are living in space, they have to drink and eat — about 1.8 pounds of food a day. And while the station recycles water, it’s not a perfect system, so replacement water has to be shipped up, too.
Astronauts produce garbage as well. So at the end of its stay at the space station, the cargo ship will be packed with all manner of refuse for a trip to the incinerator. The ship, along with its contents, will immolate on re-entry to Earth’s atmosphere.
