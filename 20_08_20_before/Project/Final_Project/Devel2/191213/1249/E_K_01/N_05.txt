SMEs Minister Park Young-sun sees potential of AI to benefit SMEs
Park Young-sun, Minister of SMEs and Startups
There is a possibility that we are beginning an era when the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by SMEs might soon start as a result of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups' discussions with two leading AI research centers during a recent trade mission in Europe.
Minister of SMEs and Startups, Park Young-sun, visited Naver Labs Europe, an AI research institute in Grenoble, France, on December 2, following his attendance at the meeting of "Digital for SMEs Initiative" held at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Naver Labs Europe is based in the former Xerox Research Center Europe (XRCE), which Naver acquired in 2017. Their simulated computer / 3D vision and human language activities feature technologies that recognize human movement through AI with images, and then model it in 3D form or emulate it by machines such as robotics.  Naver Labs Europe is mainly researching advanced technology fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and developing technology that can implement it.
Minister Park held a meeting with Michel Gastaldo, the Director of Naver Labs Europe, and looked at AI technologies, such as optical character recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision, that convert text written by people or machines into data that can be read by machines and changed into images.
Minister Park discussed with researchers about the AI ecosystem of France and whether Naver Labs Europe's AI technologies could be linked to the policy of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups. Naver Labs Europe is comprised of 26 countries including Korea, France, and India. The researchers also emphasized the need to create an atmosphere of freely shared ideas for attracting talented people internationally. Minister Park stressed that, “In today's world where technological innovation is faster than ever, sharing ideas and globalization is a necessity, not an option.”
Next, Minister Park met with Vice President Kim Moon-soo of Samsung Electronics Europe and Luč Julia, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Innovation Center on November 30 to learn more about how Samsung Electronics is managing data in Europe and applying AI to the manufacturing sector.
"The fourth industrial revolution will be led by companies that collect data, connect to the network, and make decisions with AI," Park said. "The Ministry of SMEs and Startups will provide support to build manufacturing data centers and help SMEs business use AI next year."
Minister Park's visits to the OECD and Research centers in Europe are showing the potential for the industry to easily access the keys to AI technology and all the benefits that will bring to Korean SMEs.
