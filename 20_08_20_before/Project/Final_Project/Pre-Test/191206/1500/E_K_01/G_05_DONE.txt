For years it was seen as a benign leftover of human evolution whose only claim to fame was the ability to cause agony whenever it flared up and required  removal.
Unlike cutting out an organ like the gallbladder no one missed their appendix, as it did not appear to cause any adverse health effects.
But now a study has revealed a network of immune cells helps the small, worm shaped structure play a pivotal role in maintaining digestion.
It supports the theory it is not a redundant organ and may even be a life saver.

Professor Gabrielle Belz, of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, said the findings published in Nature Immunology show the appendix deserves more credit than it has historically been given.
She said: "Popular belief tells us the appendix is a liability. Its removal is one of the most common surgical procedures in Australia, with more than 70,000 operations each year.
"However, we may wish to rethink whether the appendix is so irrelevant for our health."
Her researchers found ILCs (innate lymphoid cells) are crucial for protecting against bacterial  in people with compromised immune systems.
By preventing significant damage and inflammation of the appendix during a bacterial attack, they help it to perform an important function in the body as a natural reservoir for &apos;good&apos; bacteria.

Prof Belz said: "We have found ILCs may help the appendix to potentially reseed &apos;good&apos; bacteria within the microbiome, or community of bacteria, in the body.
"A balanced microbiome is essential for recovery from bacterial threats to gut health, such as food poisoning."
Having a healthy appendix may even save people from having to stomach more extreme options for repopulating, or &apos;balancing out&apos;, their microbiomes.

Prof Belz said: "In certain cases, people require reseeding of their intestines with healthy bacteria by faecal transplant, a process where intestinal bacteria is transplanted to a sick person from a healthy individual.
"Our research suggests ILCs may be able to play this important part in maintaining the integrity of the appendix.
"We found ILCs are part of a multi layered protective armoury of immune cells that exist in healthy individuals."

"So even when one layer is depleted, the body has &apos;back ups&apos; that can fight the infection," the professor continued.
"In people who have compromised immune systems, such as people undergoing cancer treatment, these cells are vital for fighting bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal system.
"This is particularly important because ILCs are able to survive in the gut even during these treatments, which typically wipe out other immune cells."
