Chinese smartphone brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi swept the top spots in a camera performance test.
Huawei's new product Mate 40 Pro topped the list with a total score of 136 points, said France's DXOMARK, a camera and lens evaluation company, on Nov. 15. The Mate 40 Pro received the highest score in almost every category, including resolutions, dynamic ranges (DRs), zooming, and videos, DXOMARK said.
Second place went to the Mi10 Ultra released by Xiaomi in August, which scored 133 points. The Mi10 Ultra, a high-end version of the Mi10 released by Xiaomi to mark its 10th anniversary of foundation, received high points in zooming, exposure and focusing ability. s Huawei's P40 Pro placed third with 132 points.
Apple's new models, the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the iPhone 12 Pro, grabbed fourth and fifth place with 130 points and 128 points, respectively. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the most impressive imaging function among Apple's smartphones that have been launched so far, said DXOMARK. But the model scored relatively low in zooming and dynamic range functions. In addition, Xiaomi's Mi10 Pro tied for fifth place while Vivo's X50 Pro Plus finished seventh.
Among Korean products, Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G model received the highest score of 126 points. Its overall ranking is tied for eighth place with Oppo's X2 Pro. The camera of the Galaxy S20 Ultra is superior in all aspects, but its performance in the automatic focus category is lower than that of its competitors, DXOMARK said.
In DXOMARK's smartphone camera performance tests, 13 Chinese brands made the top 20. Not only Huawei and Xiaomi, but Vivo, Oppo, OnePlus, and Honor broke into the top 20. Along with the Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G model, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G (120 points, 16th place) and the Galaxy S20 Plus (118 points, 20th place) joined the top 20 club. Apple also had three products on its list.
DXOMARK frequently evaluates the camera performance of the latest smartphones. It tested more than 3,000 images shot indoors and outdoors, filmed videos for more than 25 hours, and then gave general points by adding up points in each category.
