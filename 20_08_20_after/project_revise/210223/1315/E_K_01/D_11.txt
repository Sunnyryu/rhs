New iPhone to support 5G connectivity
On Oct 13, Apple will unveil its first line of iPhones that support 5G connectivity. The premium model will run on the superfast 5G mmWave network, a feature that rival Samsung Electronics does not yet have for its smartphones. The iPhone 12 will come in four models: iPhone 12 Mini (5.4”), iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro (6.1”) and iPhone 12 Pro Max (6.7”). All models will feature OLED panels, which was not the case for the iPhone 11. The iPhone Mini and iPhone 12 will have 4GB RAM (as with the iPhone 11 series), and the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max will have 6GB RAM. Given that OEM Foxconn has recently switched to full production capacity, we expect the smartphone to be launched this month. Shipments should reach 100mn units for the first six months, representing a 19% increase compared to the iPhone 11 launch.
iPhone 12 to be successful despite concerns
Apple should successfully address major risk factors:
(1) There have been concerns that China may boycott iPhones in the wake of the U.S. government’s recent sanctions against Chinese companies, but we think the impact will be minimal. In fact, Apple’s share of the Chinese smartphone market rose after the U.S.-China trade dispute arose (6.8% in 1H19→9.5% in 1H20). The U.S. government’s move against WeChat may entail some blowback, but not to the degree that the U.S. would ban WeChat from app stores; according to a Sep 28 U.S. court filing, there is no evidence that TikTok and WeChat pose enough of a national security threat to justify a U.S. ban.
(2) Despite Apple’s spec upgrades (e.g., cameras, display, memory and telecom chips) and 5G connectivity having led to hikes in production costs, we expect the company to maintain or cut wholesale prices via minimization of product bundling (e.g., removal of phone charger and earbuds). Recently, Apple’s strategy has focused more on high-margin/high-growth services and wearable devices, so we think maximizing sales volume will take precedent over safeguarding margins.
(3) Over the years, Apple’s high-end pricing policy and iPhone models’ lack of substantial differentiation have deterred users from purchasing newer iPhones. For instance, sales volume fell from 110mn in 2016 to 70mn units in 2018 (based on six months after launch). We think a large number of older models have not been replaced for some time, so there should be strong replacement demand for the upcoming iPhone model this year.
LG Innotek, ITM Semiconductor and BH stand to benefit
We estimate Apple smartphone shipments to total 190mn units for 2020, in line with that of 2019 (-0.2% YoY). The COVID-19 pandemic dampened 1H20 shipments (-8% YoY), but full-year performance should hold up well on the back of the iPhone 12 launch. In addition, there should be a double boost from the decline in Huawei global market share following the U.S. government’s trade sanctions as well as Chinese companies’ declining share of the Indian smartphone market amid the India-China border dispute. Against this backdrop, we maintain our positive view on major iPhone component makers LG Innotek (011070 KS), ITM Semiconductor (084850 KS) and BH (090460 KS), all of which stand to benefit.
