Folk Hero Furniture by Brazilian Brothers
The Brazilian furniture designers the Campana Brothers are known for elevating humble materials such as rope, scraps of wood and even stuffed animals: In one memorable work, a patchwork of teddy bears became a comfy chair. Their latest collection, unveiled by the São Paolo gallery Firma Casa at Design Miami, is inspired by the Cangaço, nomadic bandits who roamed northeastern Brazil in the 19th century. Intricate leatherwork recalls the elaborately embellished hats, boots and vests worn by the swashbuckling thieves.
